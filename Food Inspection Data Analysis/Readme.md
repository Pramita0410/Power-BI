# Food Inspection Data Analysis
## Hey there!

Welcome to our deep dive into the world of food inspections! I'm a data analyst who's been sifting through mountains of food inspection data to bring some clarity and insights to the surface. Using Power BI, I've transformed raw data into visual stories that reveal patterns, trends, and areas needing attention in food safety. This project is all about making data not just accessible but also engaging and informative. Let's explore the safety of what's on our plates together!

## Business Requirements
Our exploration is guided by a series of focused business requirements, structured to cover a comprehensive range of insights:

**Temporal Analysis**: Inspection trends over various time frames â€“ from yearly to daily.

**Inspection Outcomes**: The dynamics of pass vs. fail outcomes.

**Violation Categories**: Breaking down inspections by major, minor, and other violations.

**Inspection Frequency**: Identifying the most frequently inspected food establishments.

**Geographical Insights**: Analyzing inspection data by city and identifying hotspots through mapping.

**Performance Analysis**: Highlighting establishments with recurring issues and pinpointing common violation codes.

**Comparative Analysis**: City-wise breakdown of restaurants and detailed insights into violation trends area-wise.

## Power BI Dashboards

I've put together some dashboards in Power BI that serve as a window into the vast world of food inspection data. They're designed not just for data analysts but for anyone curious about food safety trends and insights. Here's what you can expect to find:

**Interactive Visuals**: Dive into the data with interactive charts and maps that let you explore every angle of food inspections.

**Insightful Metrics**: From the most inspected restaurants to the most common violations, uncover the details that matter.

**Custom Filters**: Filter the data by year, city, or violation type to find exactly what you're looking for.
