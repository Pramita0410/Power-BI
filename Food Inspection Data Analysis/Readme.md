# Food Inspection Data Analysis

## Welcome!

I'm excited to share insights from our extensive analysis of food inspection data using Power BI. This project turns complex data into easy-to-understand visual stories that highlight important trends and safety concerns in the food industry.

## Business Requirements

Our analysis addresses several key areas:

**Temporal Analysis**: Explore how inspection results change over time, from daily to yearly trends.

**Inspection Outcomes**: Understand the balance of pass and fail results in inspections.

**Violation Categories**: Look at inspections categorized by severity of violations such as major or minor.

**Inspection Frequency**: Identify which establishments are inspected most often.

**Geographical Insights**: Analyze data by location to find areas with more frequent issues.

**Performance Analysis**: Focus on places with recurring problems and common types of violations.

**Comparative Analysis**: Compare inspection results and violation trends across different cities.

## Power BI Dashboards

Our Power BI dashboards offer a clear view into the data:

**Interactive Visuals**: Engage with our data through interactive charts and maps.

**Insightful Metrics**: Discover key facts, like which restaurants are inspected most and common violations.

**Custom Filters**: Use filters to view data by year, city, or violation type to see exactly what interests you.
